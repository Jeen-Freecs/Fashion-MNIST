# Fashion-MNIST
Online Fashion Market considered to be one of the instantly growing online industries and a great area for implementing artificial intelligence tools. This tools able to understand online customers’ behavior in online-store and also consider their preferences, and with this data online-stores can to improve user experience and sales. The aim of our research article is to design 4 various machine learning models and compare their performance on image classification of clothes. In this Research paper the Fashion-MNIST was used as a dataset, while K-Nearest Neighbors, Support-Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) were used as machine learning algorithms.The difference between CNN and 3 other models is that CNN is a large multi layered Neural Network model that requires significant amount of data and powerful GPUs to train itself, however these models achieve considerably high accuracy at some problems. After conducting the data pre-processing and model training parts, we started to compare the test accuracy of each model. Analyzing the results, we can conclude that CNN model has the best performance on classifying the Fashion-MNIST with almost 0.93 accuracy.
